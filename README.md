Design Thinking: 
Data Source 
• To kickstart the earthquake prediction project, the first crucial step is to identify an 
appropriate source of data.
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database
• This suitable Kaggle dataset contains earthquake data with features like date, time, 
latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude.
Feature Exploration: 
Understanding key features 
• In earthquake prediction, these features typically include attributes like date, time, 
latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude. Understanding these features means knowing 
what they represent and their significance in relation to earthquake prediction. 
• "magnitude" is a critical feature as it quantifies the earthquake's size and impact.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
• In earthquake prediction, we use EDA to identify trends, seasonality, or geographic 
clustering of earthquake occurrences. It can also help identify outliers or anomalies in the 
data.
